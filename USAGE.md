# kbbs Usage

This guide covers installation, first-run setup, every public CLI command,
configuration, output formats, MCP operation, troubleshooting, and release
maintenance.

## Installation

### Requirements

- macOS 13 or later
- KakaoTalk for macOS
- Accessibility permission for the installed `kbbs` binary

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install channprj/tap/kbbs
```

The tap publishes `kbbs` for the latest release and retains exact-version
formulae for the ten most recent published releases.

Update an existing installation with:

```bash
kbbs update
```

`kbbs update` installs Homebrew when it is missing, installs or upgrades the
formula, and links a directly installed binary to the Homebrew-managed command.
The plain Homebrew equivalent is `brew update` followed by `brew upgrade kbbs`.

### Direct download

The release workflow publishes a universal macOS binary named
`kbbs-macos-universal`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -fL \
  https://github.com/channprj/kbbs/releases/latest/download/kbbs-macos-universal \
  -o ~/.local/bin/kbbs
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/kbbs
```

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in `PATH`, then verify the binary:

```bash
kbbs --version
```

Run `kbbs update` later to move this binary onto the Homebrew-managed release.

### Build from source

Source builds require Swift 6.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/channprj/kbbs.git
cd kbbs
swift build -c release
install -m 755 .build/release/kbbs ~/.local/bin/kbbs
```

## Quick start

Run the environment check first:

```bash
kbbs status
```

macOS may open the Accessibility settings pane. Enable the binary you actually
run, then retry `kbbs status`.

List chats and read recent messages:

```bash
kbbs chats
kbbs read "Chat name" --limit 20
```

Preview a send without changing KakaoTalk:

```bash
kbbs send "Chat name" "Hello" --dry-run
```

After verifying the target and message, omit `--dry-run` to send.

## Authentication

Commands that require interactive KakaoTalk access automatically check the
login state. If saved credentials are unavailable, `kbbs` prompts in the
terminal and stores them locally.

Enter fresh credentials explicitly:

```bash
kbbs auth login
```

Reuse stored credentials when available:

```bash
kbbs auth login --auto
```

Add `--trace-ax` to print Accessibility traversal and retry diagnostics.

The password is encrypted with AES-GCM. The credential document and encryption
key are stored separately with owner-only filesystem permissions:

```text
~/.config/kbbs/credentials.json
~/.config/kbbs/credentials/primary.key
```

### Lock mode

When KakaoTalk's lock screen is showing, commands unlock it before continuing,
then carry on with the original request.

The passcode comes from what is already stored: the passcode remembered from an
earlier unlock, otherwise the account password saved by `kbbs auth login`. `kbbs`
prompts only when neither is available, and remembers whatever worked.

Only one unlock attempt is made per command, because KakaoTalk signs the account
out after repeated wrong passcodes. A saved account password the lock screen
refuses is not tried again — run `kbbs auth login` to save the current one.

Callers without a terminal — `kbbs mcp-server`, `kbbs watch`, cron jobs — cannot
prompt, so they depend on those stored credentials.

## Command reference

### Global behavior

```bash
kbbs
kbbs --help
kbbs --version
kbbs -v
```

Running `kbbs` without a subcommand runs `status`.

### `status`

```bash
kbbs status [--verbose]
```

Checks Accessibility permission, launches KakaoTalk if needed, verifies
authentication, and prints readiness information.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--verbose` | Include window titles, indexes, positions, and sizes. |

### `auth login`

```bash
kbbs auth login [--auto] [--trace-ax]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--auto` | Use stored credentials when available; otherwise prompt and save. |
| `--trace-ax` | Print AX traversal and retry details to `stderr`. |

Without `--auto`, the command prompts for fresh credentials and replaces the
stored values.

### `chats`

```bash
kbbs chats [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Include the last visible message preview. |
| `-l N`, `--limit N` | Return at most `N` chats. Default: `20`. |
| `--trace-ax` | Print AX traversal and retry details. |
| `--json` | Return one structured JSON document. |
| `-k`, `--keep-window` | Keep a chat-list window that the command opened. |

Each result includes a local synthetic `chat_id`. The registry is refreshed by
running `kbbs chats` and stored at `~/.kbbs/chat-registry.json`.

### `read`

```bash
kbbs read <chat> [options]
kbbs read --chat-id <chat-id> [options]
```

A chat name and `--chat-id` are mutually exclusive.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--chat-id ID` | Resolve a synthetic ID produced by `kbbs chats`. |
| `-l N`, `--limit N` | Maximum messages to return. Default: `20`. |
| `--debug` | Show compact raw parsing information in text output. |
| `--trace-ax` | Print AX traversal and retry details. |
| `-k`, `--keep-window` | Keep a chat window opened by the command. |
| `--background-safe` | Read only an already exposed matching window without launching, activating, logging in, searching, opening, resizing, or closing UI. |
| `--deep-recovery` | Enable deeper window recovery after the fast path fails. |
| `--layout MODE` | Use `preserve`, `left`, `right`, `split-left`, or `split-right`. Default: `preserve`. |
| `--json` | Return one structured JSON document. |

The name form supports partial matching. For repeated automation, use a
`chat_id` after refreshing the registry with `kbbs chats`.

`--background-safe` is suitable for automation that must not disturb foreground
work, but it fails unless the matching chat window is already exposed.

#### If `--background-safe` is missing

The CLI flag is available in kbbs `v1.260618.0` and later, and belongs only to
the `kbbs read` command. Check the binary that your shell actually resolves:

```bash
kbbs --version
kbbs read --help
```

If the help output does not list the flag, update the Homebrew installation and
check again:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade kbbs
kbbs read --help
```

MCP clients use the JSON argument `background_safe: true` instead of the CLI
spelling `--background-safe`.

Messages whose author cannot be resolved are represented as `"(me)"`.

### `watch`

```bash
kbbs watch <chat> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--poll-interval S` | Poll interval in seconds. Default: `0.2`; values are clamped to `0.2...10.0`. |
| `--trace-ax` | Print AX traversal and recovery details. |
| `-k`, `--keep-window` | Keep a chat window opened by the command. |
| `--deep-recovery` | Enable deeper recovery when fast window detection fails. |
| `--json` | Emit each event as a separate pretty-printed JSON object. |
| `--include-system` | Include system rows such as date separators. |

At startup, `watch` stabilizes a transcript baseline for up to two seconds and
does not replay the existing history. Rows that cannot be assigned a safe
timestamp may be suppressed during startup.

Stop the process with Ctrl-C or `SIGTERM`.

### `send`

```bash
kbbs send <recipient> <message> [options]
kbbs send --chat-id <chat-id> <message> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--chat-id ID` | Resolve a synthetic ID produced by `kbbs chats`. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the target and message without accessing or changing KakaoTalk. |
| `--trace-ax` | Print AX traversal and retry details. |
| `--no-cache` | Disable AX path cache use for this invocation. |
| `--refresh-cache` | Remove relevant cached paths before sending. |
| `-k`, `--keep-window` | Keep chat and list windows opened by the command. |
| `--deep-recovery` | Enable deeper recovery after the fast path fails. |

Without `--keep-window`, windows opened transiently by the command are closed
after the send attempt.

### `send-image`

```bash
kbbs send-image <recipient> <image-path> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--trace-ax` | Print AX traversal and retry details. |
| `--no-cache` | Disable AX path cache use for this invocation. |
| `-k`, `--keep-window` | Keep chat and list windows opened by the command. |
| `--deep-recovery` | Enable deeper recovery after the fast path fails. |

The path must point to a readable image. `kbbs` loads the image into the macOS
pasteboard and completes KakaoTalk's image-send UI.

### `inspect`

```bash
kbbs inspect [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-d N`, `--depth N` | Maximum hierarchy depth. Default: `4`. |
| `-w N`, `--window N` | Inspect a window by zero-based index. |
| `--show-attributes` | Print available AX attributes. |
| `--show-path` | Print the hierarchy path. |
| `--show-frame` | Print element frames. |
| `--show-index` | Print sibling indexes. |
| `--show-flags` | Print enabled, focused, selected, and editable state. |
| `--show-actions` | Print supported AX actions. |
| `--debug-layout` | Enable path, frame, index, and state output together. |
| `--row-summary` | Print message-row parsing diagnostics. |
| `--row-range A:B` | Limit row summaries to an inclusive zero-based range. |

`--row-range` applies only with `--row-summary`.

### `cache`

```bash
kbbs cache
kbbs cache status
kbbs cache clear
kbbs cache export <output-path>
kbbs cache import <input-path>
kbbs cache warmup [options]
```

Running `kbbs cache` without a subcommand runs `cache status`.

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `status` | Show path, schema, KakaoTalk fingerprint, entry count, and update time. |
| `clear` | Delete the local AX path cache. |
| `export PATH` | Export the current cache document as JSON. |
| `import PATH` | Import JSON after schema and KakaoTalk fingerprint validation. |
| `warmup` | Discover and store common chat-list, search, and input paths. |

`cache warmup` accepts:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--recipient NAME` | Also warm the chat-open and message-input path for a recipient. |
| `--trace-ax` | Print AX traversal and retry details. |
| `-k`, `--keep-window` | Keep a chat window opened by warmup. |

### `mcp-server`

```bash
kbbs mcp-server
```

Starts the native stdio MCP server. It accepts both `Content-Length` framing and
one JSON-RPC request per line, and responds using the request's transport style.

The server exposes:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kbbs_read` | Read by `chat` or `chat_id`, with limit, layout, recovery, background-safe, window, and trace controls. |
| `kbbs_send` | Send a text message by chat name. |
| `kbbs_send_image` | Send a local image by chat name. |

For send tools, `confirm=false` or an omitted `confirm` sends immediately.
`confirm=true` does not send; it returns `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` so a supervisor
can request approval and call again.

See [docs/openclaw.md](docs/openclaw.md) for complete integration examples.

### `update`

```bash
kbbs update
```

Moves the current installation onto the Homebrew-managed release:

1. Finds `brew` on `PATH`, at `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`, or at
   `/usr/local/bin/brew`, and runs Homebrew's official installer when none of
   them exists.
2. Runs `brew install` or `brew upgrade` for `channprj/tap/kbbs`.
3. Verifies the resulting binary by running it with `--version`.
4. Replaces a directly installed `kbbs` with a link to the verified binary, so
   the path the shell already resolved keeps working. A build product under
   `.build` is never replaced.

Progress goes to `stderr` and the final summary to `stdout`. Homebrew or `sudo`
may ask for confirmation. The command needs no Accessibility permission and
never edits shell startup files.

## JSON output

### Chats

```bash
kbbs chats --json
```

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "chats": [
    {
      "title": "홍길동",
      "chat_id": "chat_7f42c5e1d9ab",
      "last_message": "곧 도착해요"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Read

```bash
kbbs read "홍길동" --limit 20 --json
```

```json
{
  "chat": "홍길동",
  "fetched_at": "2026-02-26T01:23:45.678Z",
  "count": 1,
  "messages": [
    {
      "author": "홍길동",
      "time_raw": "00:27",
      "date": "2026-02-26",
      "body": "밤이 깊었네",
      "has_image": false,
      "image_count": 0,
      "link_count": 0,
      "has_attachment": false,
      "attachment_count": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

`date` and `time_raw` may be absent when KakaoTalk does not expose the
corresponding metadata.

### Watch

```bash
kbbs watch "홍길동" --json
```

```json
{
  "chat": "홍길동",
  "detected_at": "2026-03-25T10:20:30.123Z",
  "event": "message",
  "message": {
    "author": "홍길동",
    "time_raw": "10:20",
    "body": "새 메시지",
    "has_image": false,
    "image_count": 0,
    "link_count": 0,
    "has_attachment": false,
    "attachment_count": 0
  }
}
```

With `--include-system`, `event` may be `"system"`.

JSON payloads are written to `stdout`. `--trace-ax` diagnostics remain on
`stderr`.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Behavior |
|---|---:|---|
| `KBBS_AX_TIMEOUT` | `0.25` | AX messaging timeout in seconds. Accepted range: `0.05...5.0`; invalid values fall back to the default. |
| `KBBS_DEFAULT_DEEP_RECOVERY` | `false` | Default `deep_recovery` value for MCP tools. |
| `KBBS_DEFAULT_BACKGROUND_SAFE` | `false` | Default `background_safe` value for `kbbs_read`. |
| `KBBS_TRACE_DEFAULT` | `false` | Default `trace_ax` value for MCP tools. |
| `KBBS_DEFAULT_READ_LAYOUT` | `preserve` | Default MCP read layout: `preserve`, `left`, `right`, `split-left`, or `split-right`. |
| `KBBS_MCP_STARTUP_STATUS_CHECK` | `false` | When `true`, MCP initialization also runs `kbbs status`; otherwise it checks only the binary version. |
| `KBBS_MCP_VERSION` | build version | Overrides MCP server version metadata. |

Example:

```bash
KBBS_DEFAULT_BACKGROUND_SAFE=true \
KBBS_DEFAULT_READ_LAYOUT=split-right \
kbbs mcp-server
```

### Local state

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.config/kbbs/credentials.json` | Encrypted credential document. |
| `~/.config/kbbs/credentials/primary.key` | Local AES-GCM key. |
| `~/.kbbs/chat-registry.json` | Synthetic chat identities. |
| `~/.kbbs/ax-cache.json` | Self-healing AX paths. |

Do not publish these files or include their contents in issue reports.

## Examples

Read without disturbing foreground windows:

```bash
kbbs read "홍길동" --json --background-safe
```

Read by synthetic ID and arrange the window on the right:

```bash
kbbs chats --json
kbbs read --chat-id "chat_7f42c5e1d9ab" \
  --layout split-right \
  --limit 50 \
  --json
```

Watch for new messages:

```bash
kbbs watch "홍길동" --json --poll-interval 0.5
```

Preview and then send:

```bash
kbbs send "홍길동" "안녕하세요" --dry-run
kbbs send "홍길동" "안녕하세요"
```

Warm and inspect the AX cache:

```bash
kbbs cache warmup --recipient "홍길동" --trace-ax
kbbs cache status
```

Collect parsing diagnostics:

```bash
kbbs inspect --window 0 --depth 20 --debug-layout
kbbs inspect --window 0 --depth 20 --row-summary --row-range 10:30
kbbs read "홍길동" --limit 20 --trace-ax
```

## Troubleshooting

### Accessibility permission is not granted

1. Run `kbbs status`.
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**.
3. Add or enable the exact `kbbs` binary you run.
4. Retry `kbbs status`.

A rebuilt or moved binary may need to be added again.

### KakaoTalk cannot be launched or has no usable window

Open KakaoTalk manually, complete login if necessary, and run:

```bash
kbbs status --verbose
```

Use `--deep-recovery` only when the normal fast path cannot recover a window.

### A chat name or `chat_id` is not found

Refresh local identities:

```bash
kbbs chats --json
```

A renamed room receives a new local identity. If duplicate rooms have the same
name, prefer the `chat_id` values produced from the current chat list.

### Background-safe read fails

`--background-safe` never opens or searches for a chat. Expose the target chat
window first, or omit the flag when foreground automation is acceptable.

### Messages cannot be parsed

Collect both hierarchy and trace evidence:

```bash
kbbs inspect --window 0 --depth 20 --row-summary
kbbs read "Chat name" --trace-ax
```

Attach the relevant output to an issue after removing private message content.

### Cached paths appear stale

```bash
kbbs cache status
kbbs cache clear
```

Verify target and message parsing without touching KakaoTalk:

```bash
kbbs send "Chat name" "Test" --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` exits before KakaoTalk access. If a real test send is acceptable,
retry that send with `--no-cache` to compare the uncached UI path:

```bash
kbbs send "Chat name" "Test" --no-cache
```

### MCP initialization fails

Verify the binary directly:

```bash
kbbs --version
kbbs status
kbbs mcp-server
```

The MCP server skips the interactive status check by default. Set
`KBBS_MCP_STARTUP_STATUS_CHECK=true` only when startup should validate full
KakaoTalk readiness.

## Development and releases

Build debug and release variants:

```bash
swift build
swift build -c release
.build/debug/kbbs --version
```

Useful manual checks:

```bash
.build/debug/kbbs status --verbose
.build/debug/kbbs inspect --depth 5
.build/debug/kbbs chats --verbose --limit 20
.build/debug/kbbs send "Name" "Message" --dry-run
.build/debug/kbbs read "Chat" --limit 50
```

The root `VERSION` file is managed through Headatever-backed make targets:

```bash
make version
make release
make release-major
make release-push
```

Do not hand-edit `VERSION`. See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for the
`MAJOR.YYMMDD.PATCH_COUNT` rules.

Pushing a matching `v*` tag triggers the release workflow, which:

1. Builds arm64 and x86_64 release binaries.
2. combines them as `kbbs-macos-universal`;
3. verifies the embedded version against the tag;
4. creates or updates the GitHub Release; and
5. synchronizes the required Homebrew tap metadata.
